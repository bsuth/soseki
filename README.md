# Sōseki Project

The purpose of this site is to make the works of Natsume Sōseki more accessible to 
students of Japanese. These works date from the early 1900s, and the language can be 
challenging, but reading the original texts is well worth the effort.

## <a name="introduction"></a> Introduction
Welcome to Sōseki Project's Github! Here you will find the source code for
the website as well as the build files (built with Webpack using create-react-app).

This site is strictly non-commercial, with no advertisements or solicitations. 
The only request of site users is to provide comments or suggestions 
for how the site could be improved. Also, a short note from any who find the site 
useful would be appreciated, as the site coding includes no scripts to track users or usage.

## <a name="features"></a> Features
The site provides a number of tools to assist the reader.
However, a solid understanding of Japanese grammar and mastery of basic 
vocabulary have been assumed in order keep the extent of vocabulary helps, 
explanations, and notes reasonable. A minimum of two or three years of college-level 
Japanese study (or equivalent) is recommended before starting on these works.

## <a name="contact"></a> Contact
Please contact Ian Sutherland at Sōseki Project (sosekiproject@gmail.com) with any questions, 
suggestions, corrections (note title and section number), or general comments. Especially 
looking for proofreading help from anyone willing to flag errors and sent notification.

## <a name="contribute"></a> Contributing
This is a branch of the original Sōseki Project, implemented with [React](https://reactjs.org/).
The switch to React was encouraged to achieve a better UI/UX while still having
relatively maintainable code.
