		<p>Dear User,</p>
		<p>
            This site has been serving as an experimental version of
            <a href="https://sosekiproject.org"> sosekiproject.org</a>, with a
            number of new features and an alternate UI. It was written by the
            son of the original site author and also served as a project for learning
            <a href="https://reactjs.org/"> ReactJS</a> and <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">GatsbyJS</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            From here on out, the features that we thought worked well will be
            integrated over time into the original site, while some other features
            will be simply discontinued. The goal in the end is to create a site
            that will greatly open up the world of S≈çseki to students of Japanese,
            as well as those Japanese readers who simply need some assistance in
            reading these older works. If you found this resource helpful, please
            continue to use the version of the site at the above link. Also feel
            free to reach out! Any feedback is always appreciated.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you so much for using this site up to now. Writing this project
            was a great experience, and I hope that you've been able to enjoy
            it as much as I have. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Best, <br/>
