It was written by the\n            son of the original site author and also served as a project for learning\n            <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\"> ReactJS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">GatsbyJS</a>.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            From here on out, the features that we thought worked well will be\n            integrated over time into the original site, while some other features\n            will be simply discontinued. The goal in the end is to create a site\n            that will greatly open up the world of S≈çseki to students of Japanese,\n            as well as those Japanese readers who simply need some assistance in\n            reading these older works.

Any feedback is always appreciated.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Thank you so much for using this site up to now. Writing this project\n            was a great experience, and I hope that you've been able to enjoy\n            it as much as I have. \n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Best, <br/>\n            Brian Sutherland\n        </p>\n\t</div>\n);\n\n/////////// DEPRECIATE NOTICE //////////\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
