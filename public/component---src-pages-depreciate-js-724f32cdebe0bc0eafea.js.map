It was also written\n            by the son of the original author and served as a project to learn\n            <a href=\"REACT_LINK_HERE\"> ReactJS</a> and <a href=\"GATSBY_LINK_HERE\">Gatsby</a>.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            From here on out, the features that we thought worked well will slowly\n            be integrated into the original site, while others will simply remain\n            unimplemented. The goal by the end is to create a website that will\n            greatly open up the world of S≈çseki to students of Japanese, as well as\n            those who simply wish to read his works.

Writing this project\n            was a great experience, and I hope that you've been able to enjoy\n            it as much as I have. \n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Best, <br/>\n            Brian Sutherland\n        </p>\n\t</div>\n);\n\n/////////// DEPRECIATE NOTICE //////////\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
